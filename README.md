# Twitter Bot By Wasim
## Introduction

This is a simple Twitter bot script written in Python using the Tweepy library. The bot is designed to post a tweet on your Twitter profile. You can customize the tweet text and modify the code to include media such as images, videos, or files.

## Getting Started

Before running the bot, you need to set up a Twitter Developer account and obtain API keys. Follow the steps below:

1. Go to [Twitter Developer](https://developer.twitter.com/) and log in or create an account.

2. Create a new Twitter App to obtain API keys. You will need the following:
   - API Key
   - API Secret Key
   - Bearer Token
   - Access Token
   - Access Token Secret

3. Replace the placeholder values in the code with your actual API keys. The placeholders are marked in the code with comments.

   ```python
   api_key = 'YOUR_API_KEY'
   api_secret = 'YOUR_API_SECRET'
   bearer_token = 'YOUR_BEARER_TOKEN'
   access_token = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN'
   access_token_secret = 'YOUR_ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET'
   ```

4. Save the modified script.

## Usage

1. Install the required library by running the following command:

   ```
   pip install tweepy
   ```

2. Run the script:

   ```python
   python twitter_bot.py
   ```

   The script will post a tweet with the specified text on your Twitter profile. You can customize the tweet text within the script.

## Note

- Ensure that you have Python installed on your machine.
- Be cautious with your API keys and tokens. Keep them confidential to prevent unauthorized access to your Twitter account.
- The script uses Tweepy, a third-party library. Make sure to install it before running the script.

Feel free to explore and modify the script according to your needs. If you encounter any issues, refer to the Tweepy documentation or seek assistance from the Twitter Developer community. Happy tweeting! üöÄüê¶
